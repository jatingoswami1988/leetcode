Binary Tree Notes:-

1)Diameter of BT is Math.max(height(root.left)+height(root.right),Math.max(diameter(root.left),diameter(root.right)) --> Viveka youtube

Return max of following three
          1) Diameter of left subtree
          2) Diameter of right subtree
          3) Height of left subtree + height of right subtree + 1

2)Left and Right view  use this solution :-  https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/submissions/

3)A height balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and right subtree of any 
node does not differ by more than 1 and both the left and right subtree are also height balanced.

Binary Search Tree :-

Check if Tree is BST or not -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/
