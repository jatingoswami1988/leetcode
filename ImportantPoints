#################################################################

25 concepts that make System Design easier:

1. Scalability - How will your system handle growth? Vertical or Horizontal scaling?

2. Latency and Throughput - Essential performance measures.

3. Database design - SQL or NoSQL? Understand their strengths and weaknesses.

4. Indexing - Understand database indexes and their performance implications.

5. Load Balancing - Understand different algorithms and their use cases.

6. Caching - Caching can dramatically increase the speed of data retrieval. Know different strategies, benefits and trade-offs.

7. Networking Basics - TCP/IP, HTTP vs HTTPS, UDP, DNS lookups.

8. Microservices Architecture - Learn how to decompose a large system into manageable parts.

9. Data Sharding - As your data grows, how will you distribute it?Understand different sharding techniques and their trade-offs.

10. CAP Theorem - Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance - you can only pick two.

11. System Interfaces - API design and best practices.

12. Redundancy and Failover - Learn how to design a highly available system.
